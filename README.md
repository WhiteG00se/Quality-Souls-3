# included 3rd Party Mods

- Seamless Coop https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls3/mods/1895?tab=files&file_id=7074
- Proper PC Experience Mod https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls3/mods/1545?tab=files

# how to install

- either GIT CLONE this repo or download this repo ("code" -> "Download ZIP") and unzip it (to anywhere you like, but not into the game folder)

- move the files from the "proper_pc_experience_mod" folder into the same folder as the game's .exe ("[...]\steamapps\common\DARK SOULS III\Game")

- edit the files "d3d11_fov.ini", "d3d11_fps.ini" and "d3d11_refreshrate.ini" to your liking. The fov number is added to the game's default and it's in degrees. For refresh rate I recommend your screen's native refresh rate in most cases. For fps I recommend 120 (otherwise 60), other numbers will mess with the physics and might cause de-sync between guests and session host.

- run z_launchmod_darksouls3.bat

- change "Launch Settings" to "Play Offline" ingame and restart the game

# important info

- Seamless Coop is not compatible with Steam save game cloud sync
